## About

MFTracker (My Finance Tracker) is an open-source mobile app that automatically tracks your monthly expenses by reading transaction notifications from banking apps, UPI services, and payment platforms. It categorizes your spending, provides insights, and helps you manage your budget - all without connecting to your bank account.

### Why MFTracker

Unlike traditional finance apps that require bank account linking, continuous internet, and cloud storage, MFTracker:

- Works completely offline (no internet permission)
- Uses only notification access (no SMS permission needed)
- Stores data locally on your device (SQLite)
- Zero setup - just install and grant notification permission
- Open source - verify the code yourself

## Features

- **Automatic Notification Parsing** - Reads transaction notifications from 20+ Indian banks and payment apps
- **Smart Categorization** - Rule-based transaction categorization (Food, Shopping, Bills, etc.)
- **Analytics and Insights** - Visual charts, spending trends, and budget tracking
- **Multi-Account Support** - Track multiple bank accounts and credit cards
- **Privacy First** - All data stored locally, 100% offline, no internet access
- **Lightweight** - 85.9MB APK, less than 50MB RAM usage
- **Material Design 3** - Modern, beautiful UI with dark mode

## Installation

### For Users

1. Download the APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
2. Disable Play Protect temporarily (required - see note below)
3. Install the APK on your device
4. Grant notification permission in Settings
5. Re-enable Play Protect

Note: Google Play Protect will block this app because it uses `NotificationListenerService`. This is expected behavior for sideloaded apps with sensitive permissions. The app is safe - it is open source, 100% offline, and has no internet access.
